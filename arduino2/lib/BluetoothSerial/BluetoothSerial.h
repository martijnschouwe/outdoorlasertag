/**
 * BluetoothSerial Class
 *
 * It is derived from SoftwareSerial class and
 * adds methods to access the control pins of the Bluetooth module.
 *
 * Required constructor parameters are the pins on which to receive / transmit
 * serial data from / to the Bluetooth module.
 * The optional parameters are the pins numbers through which to control
 * the Bluetooth module.
 *
 * In order to simulate named (key-value pair) parameter passing style,
 * all the optional constructor parameters are methods of BluetoothControlPIns class.
 * They return a reference to their *this object, so the method calls can be chained.
 *
 * According to positional parameters passing, a caller of a function has to list
 * its parameters following the order declared in the methodâ€™s signature.
 * Also, default values can only be given to the last parameters,
 * so it is not possible to specify one of the later parameters and use
 * the default value for former ones.
 * Named parameters let the caller pass the parameters to a function
 * in any order and they are distinguished by a name.
 * So the caller can explicitly pass all the needed parameters and default values
 * without worrying about the order used in the function declaration.
